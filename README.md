🚀 SIMPLE JAVA BLOCK CHAIN
A lightweight implementation of a blockchain using Java. This project demonstrates the core concepts of cryptographic hashing,
Proof of Work (Mining), and chain validation.

🛠 FEATURES
  SHA-256 Hashing: Secure digital fingerprints for every block.
  Proof of Work: A mining system with adjustable difficulty.
  Integrity System: Automatic validation to detect if any block has been tampered with.
  JSON Export: Uses Google’s GSON library to display the ledger in a readable format.
